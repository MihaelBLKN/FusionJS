# FusionWebTS
## Fusion Web Typescript

This is a port of the ROBLOX UI framework [Fusion](https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion), but for the use on the web as a frontend framework.

Documentation is still work in progress.

Currently, this project is still work in progress but all the API is there, I do not recommend using this project on a production-scale app in the meantime. Currently adjusting to **0.3** API.
